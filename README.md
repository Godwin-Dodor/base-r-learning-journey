# Base R learning journey
This is my journey of learning and documenting base R.  
I am learning base R from scratch to become proficient in data analysis and data manipulation.

## Personal goals
1. Master Base R Fundamentals and advances.
2. Complete at least 10 projects in this journey
3. Build a strong portfolio

## This is my structured learning path and I will keep updating it as I progress
### Topic 1: Fundamentals of R
1. Lesson01: Environment Setup in R.
I learned Working directory (getwd(), setwd()), listing files in the working directory using (list.files()), listing hidden files in the working directory by setting all.files = TRUE, 
workspace management (ls(), rm()), package handling using (search(), .libPaths(), install.packages(), library())

2. Lesson02: Basic Operations in R.
I learned Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, ^, %%, %/%), variable assignment (<-), comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=), logical operators (&, |, !), 
operator precedence(PEMDAS), variable naming rules.

3. Lesson03: Special Values in R.
I learned NA (missing values, is.na(), na.rm = TRUE), NULL (empty objects, is.null()), NaN (invalid math, is.nan()), Inf and -Inf (infinity, is.infinite(),is.finite()), 
as well as handling and removing special values.
